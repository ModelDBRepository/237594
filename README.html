<h1>running</h1>

<ul>
<li>the files in the mechanism folder need to compiled by NEURON</li>
<li>use the NEURON gui to launch the file mechanism/run_act.hoc</li>
<li>this will run the code with a current injection and save data on channels in the AIS and voltages accross the neuron to the data folder</li>
</ul>
Afer a minute or so a graph appears whose first action potential should look something like:<p/>

which is similar to the AP in figure 5 of the paper.<p/>
<h1>overview</h1>

<ul>
<li>the mechanism folder includes mod files for channels as well as the main running file
<ul>
<li>files with "_stoch" in the name are stochastic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>main.hoc initializes everything
<ul>
<li>the morphology folder includes files detailing the shapes of different axons</li>
<li>density<em>mechs.hoc distributes the passive and active conductances through the NEURON</li>
<li>inject</em>soma.hoc inserts an IClamp at the soma and runs the simulation</li>
<li>c.ses loads a gui for viewing the voltage over time
<ul>
<li>recording.hoc defines methods for recording / saving data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>mechanism/run_act.hoc runs and displays an example action potential</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the model is largely based on: (Hu, et al. 2009): "Distinct contributions of Na v 1.6 and Na v 1.2 in action potential initiation and backpropagation.", which was itself built up through several studies
<ul>
<li>the main change is the change to stochastic Na channels   </li>
<li>other minor changes are described in the paper (Singh &amp; Levy, 2017) "A consensus layer V pyramidal neuron can sustain interpulse-interval coding."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>part of model is based on
